# AquaSentinel-system-prediction-using-SONAR-principle
 A predictive system that utilizes sonar signals to assess the nature of objects beneath a submarine, distinguishing between explosive mines and inert rocks. By leveraging ML, a logistic regression model, the system will analyze sonar data to provide real-time predictions, aiding submarines in navigating safely through ocean territories.
