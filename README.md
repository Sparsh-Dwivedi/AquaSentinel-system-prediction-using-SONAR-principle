# AquaSentinel-system-prediction-using-SONAR-principle
 A predictive system that utilizes sonar signals to assess the nature of objects beneath a submarine, distinguishing between explosive mines and inert rocks. By leveraging ML, a logistic regression model, the system will analyze sonar data to provide real-time predictions, aiding submarines in navigating safely through ocean territories.

Complete Description

Problem Statement:
In the midst of an ongoing conflict between two nations, submarine navigation poses a critical challenge as enemy territories have strategically planted explosive mines within the ocean depths. To address this peril, our objective is to develop a sophisticated " Mine and Rock Detection System ". The system aims to equip submarines with the capability to predict and differentiate between potentially hazardous mines and harmless rocks during their underwater missions.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to create a predictive system that utilizes sonar signals to assess the nature of objects beneath a submarine, distinguishing between explosive mines and inert rocks. By leveraging machine learning, specifically a logistic regression model, the system will analyze sonar data to provide real-time predictions, aiding submarines in navigating safely through ocean territories.

Key Components:

a) Sonar Signal Processing: Implement a system that efficiently processes sonar signals emitted by the submarine and interprets the returning echoes.

b) Dataset Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset comprising sonar readings from regions with known mine and rock locations, simulating diverse underwater scenarios.

c) Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data, ensuring it is suitable for model training. This involves handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

d) Logistic Regression Model: Employ a logistic regression machine learning model to learn patterns from the sonar data and predict whether the detected object is a mine or a rock.

e) Model Training and Evaluation: Train the logistic regression model using the training dataset and evaluate its performance on a separate test dataset to ensure reliable predictions.

f) Real-Time Prediction: Implement a mechanism for real-time prediction, allowing the system to continuously analyze incoming sonar signals and provide timely feedback to the submarine.

Expected Outcome:
The  AquaSentinel-system-prediction(using-SONAR-principle) aims to enhance the safety and efficiency of submarine navigation by accurately predicting the nature of underwater objects. With successful implementation, submarines will be better equipped to avoid potentially dangerous mines, mitigating risks and ensuring the success of critical underwater missions.
